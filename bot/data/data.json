        "nbestanswers": [
            "A small group of politicians believed strongly that the fact that Saddam Hussien remained in power after the first Gulf War was a signal of weakness to the rest of the world, one that invited attacks and terrorism. Shortly after taking power with George Bush in 2000 and after the attack on 9/11, they were able to use the terrorist attacks to justify war with Iraq on this basis and exaggerated threats of the development of weapons of mass destruction. The military strength of the U.S. and the brutality of Saddam's regime led them to imagine that the military and political victory would be relatively easy.", 
            "Because there is a lot of oil in Iraq.", 
            "It is tempting to say that the US invaded Iraq because it has lots of oil, but the US is not a country in a deep economic problem that capturing other country\u2019s oil is an actual need for survival. It is more likely that the Iraq invading Kuwait scenario would fall under that assumption.. I think that the US government has come to a conclusion that we are on the verge of a war of religions, or more likely ideologies. It would be presumptuous to try and determent a one cause to the coming war. . I think that the world wide spread of the media with its many forms (Cable, Satellite, Internet, etc.)  have pushed the Moslem regimes to the extreme, fearing that secularity and democratic influence is penetrating their country and will result in an up raising against them. One of the best way to maintain the power that you have and even gain more of it, is by hatred. When the common man is occupied hating an outside enemy, its hatred is kept out side the county and would not be directed towards the regime. . So- I believe that the US understands that the fanatic Moslem regimes have already started a war on the democratic world and now is the time to try a fight it.. . So why invade Iraq? Because it is a huge, week Moslem country that thought to be easy to defeat. . This is exactly the same reason why Afghanistan was first and Syria is next in line.", 
            "I think Yuval is pretty spot on. It's a proving ground and a focal point for terror activity that's not on American soil. And, because no one liked Saddam Hussein, no other countries (even in the Middle East) were about to rise up and join his side.. . Rabid speculation: now the Pentagon has a model that says it takes ~5 years, ~$200B and ~2,000 casualties to \"rebuild\" a dictatorship into a democracy. Who's next on the list?"

            "Don't try this yourself but this is what the old fashioned way is - done in some villages in other parts of the world.. . The guy who dismantles, wears a mask with holes at the eyes so he can see, carries a big sack with burning coals in it.  He also wraps his hands with thick cloths, carries an empty bag to collect the honey in it.. He then collects the honey in the empty bag, pulls the hive into the bag of coals.. . If he just wants to collect the honey, he would leave after collecting the honey - but the bag of coals is used to choke & burn the bees if he wanted to get rid of the hive.. . That's a bit like coding in COBOL & assembly :)"

            "You could try to get the owners of the property to sell to you on a lease option for say 2 years, and lets say that you pay 500 a month, with 500 down, then you would have control of the property and you could do your fix-ups or rent it out and collect the rent.( Be sure and include that in the offer that you can rent the property out) You should be able to get a 2nd mortgage to do your rehabs, (most banks would want to be in 1st position and the owner would hold the 2nd mortgage) If you have control of the property it makes thing alot easier, check out a mortgage broker they can usually find something.

On a 30 year fixed today the approximate rate would be 8.75% with a 1% loan fee and .500 in discount or 7.25 with a 1% loan fee and 2% in discount.

            "As others pointed out, there are investor lenders out there who do 100% financing. Another way is to partner up with someone who has money. If the profit margin is high enough, you can split it with the person who fronts you the cash.. . Regards.", 
            "You can finance up to 100% of the property value. The only kicker is, the terms of your loan may not be as good. Higher interest rates or origination fees may abound. A simple way to figure whether or not this will be a good idea is to calculate your potential income and your expenses and initial sunk costs. This is a gross oversimplification and I would recommend that you speak to a qualified CPA before you make this leap. As usual, I recommend being very conservative in your estimates, assume a few worst case scenarios (ie no rental income between renters) and if the numbers still come out good... then go for it! :) Good luck!. . **EDIT. . I almost forgot to give you a specific loan type!! You can ask for an 80/20 loan. Where you get a traditional loan for 80% of the value with no PMI (private mortgage insurance), and get another 20% loan for the downpayment (this will be at a higher interest rate and you should pay this one down as quickly as possible). Ask your loan officer about this. They may also be able to offer you other alternatives. Good luck! :)"
